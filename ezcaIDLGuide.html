  <h2>
    <a id="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
  <p>
    ezcaIDL is a library of routines for <a href="http://sslab.colorado.edu:2222/projects/IDL/idl_ssl_home.html">
      IDL</a> and <a href="http://www.vni.com/pvwave.dir/wavehome.html">PV-WAVE</a>
    which provides an interface to EPICS Channel Access through the EZCA and EzcaScan
    libraries.
  </p>
  <p>
    PV-WAVE and IDL are closely related packages which are described as <cite>Data Visualization
      Tools</cite>. They consist of a general purpose interpreted language with very
    good graphics routines. Although not described as tools for data collection and
    control applications, their rapid prototyping capabilities and sophisticated graphics
    make them a nice environment for these applications. Both also provide easy to use
    widget toolkits for quickly developing GUI applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although there is nearly a one-for-one match between the routines in ezcaIDL and
    the EZCA and EzcaScan libraries, the syntax of the IDL routines is not the same
    as the syntax of the corresponding EZCA and EzcaScan routines. The reason for this
    is that IDL is more "object oriented" and relieves the programmer of much of the
    detailed bookkeeping required of the C programmer. Thus for example, the IDL routine
    <code>caGet()</code> returns, by default, a value which has the native data type
    and element count of the process variable. This is not true of the corresponding
    C routine <code>ezcaGet()</code>, which requires the user to specify the data type
    and number of elements to be returned.
  </p>
  <h2>
    <a id="Release">Release notes</a></h2>
  <p>
    The following are the more important notes taken from the CVS log file.</p>
  <h3>
    2012/12/12</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added a new function ezcaPVNameToByte which is now called instead of ezcaStringToByte
      for all PV names; it allows up to MAX_PVNAME_SIZE=128 characters in a PV name, rather
      than MAX_STRING_SIZE=40. EPICS CA should now be the limit on PV name size, not ezcaIDL.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    2011/10/21</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added optional count parameter to caSetMonitor.</li>
    <li>ezcaIDL now finds the shareable library either by the environment variable EZCA_IDL_SHARE
      or by a new mechanism: the shareable library is searched for in IDL_PATH using the
      name base_VERSION.OS_VERSION.ARCH, where base is libezcaIDL.so or ezcaIDL.dll.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    2001/9/28</h3>
  <p>
    This was a signficant rewrite.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No string variables are passed to the shareable libraries in this version. This
      was done to simplify things, since there are now at least 4 different conventions
      for passing strings to shareable libraries (PVWAVE, IDL prior to 5.1 on Windows,
      IDL 5.1-5.4, and IDL 5.5 and later). We now only pass byte arrays, not strings.
      This permits a single shareable library to be used for any version of PV-WAVE or
      IDL.</li>
    <li>There are now 2 constants in ezca_common, MAX_STRING_SIZE and MAX_ENUM_STATES.
      These values are set to 40 and 16 respectively in caInit. It is now MANDATORY to
      call caInit before calling any other routine in this file, preferably in the IDL_STARTUP
      file.</li>
    <li>Reformatted a lot of the code, and used ENDIF and ENDFOR consistently rather than
      simple END statements.</li>
    <li>Added support for unsigned short and unsigned long integer data types.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
    <a id="Procedures">Procedures and Functions</a></h2>
  <p>
    PV-WAVE and IDL are similar to FORTRAN in that they have two types of routines,
    procedures and functions. Procedure are similar to FORTRAN subroutines: they do
    not return a value. Functions, as in C or FORTRAN, return a value. ezcaIDL uses
    functions for all EZCA routines which return either status or data. Procedures are
    used for routines which return <code>void</code>, i.e. neither data nor status.
  </p>
  <p>
    Procedure and function names are not case sensitive. Of course, the names of channel
    access process variables <em>are</em> case sensitive and must be specified correctly.
  </p>
  <h2>

    <a id="Related">Related Documentation</a></h2>
  <p>
    In addition to this ezcaIDL Users' Guide the following documentation will be useful
    to the IDL programmer using ezcaIDL.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="ezcaIDLRef.html">ezcaIDL Reference Guide</a> This document contains a
      detailed description of all of the ezcaIDL routines. It is extracted directly from
      the standard documentation headers for each routine in the source file <code>ezcaIDL.pro</code>.
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://epics.aps.anl.gov/asd/controls/epics/manuals/EzCaPrimer/EzcaPrimer.html">
      EZCA Primer</a> This document contains an overview of the EZCA C library, which
      is used by ezcaIDL. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
    <a id="Synchronous">Synchronous Groups</a></h2>
  <p>
    Normally all ezcaIDL calls, such as <code>caGet()</code> and <code>caPut()</code>
    wait for all required channel access operations to complete before they return.
    This is often convenient, but it is very inefficient if one wants to read/write
    a large number of process variables. In this case it is much more efficient to submit
    a group of channel access requests, and then wait for them all to complete.
  </p>
  <p>
    ezcaIDL supports the concept of "synchronous groups" in the EZCA library. A synchronous
    group is started by calling</p>
  <pre>
    caStartGroup
</pre>
  <p>
    Once a synchronous group is started, subsequent calls to routines like <code>caGet()</code>,
    <code>caPut()</code>, etc. simply queue a channel access operation, and do not actually
    perform the channel access I/O. Calling</p>
  <pre>
    status = caEndGroup()
</pre>
  <p>
    ends a synchronous group. This causes all of the queued channel access calls to
    be issued and waits for them to complete.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two important restrictions which must be kept in mind when calling any
    of the <code>caGetxxx()</code> routines (e.g. <code>caGet()</code>, <code>caGetUnits()</code>,
    <code>caGetControlLimits()</code>, etc.) from inside a synchronous group, i.e. after
    calling <code>caStartGroup</code> and before calling <code>caEndGroup()</code>.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The IDL variable(s) which contain the return data values must not be "re-used"
      or deleted before the call to <code>caEndGroup()</code>. The reason for this is
      that EZCA has been passed the addresses of these variables as the locations to which
      the data are to be copied when <code>caEndGroup()</code> is called. Thus, these
      locations must still point to a valid memory location when <code>caEndGroup()</code>
      is called. <em>If the output variables are re-used then IDL's behavior is unpredictable,
        and bus errors/access violations could occur.</em> In practice, fatal errors have
      not been observed, but they are possible. </li>
    <li>When using <code>caGet()</code> to read strings, the data type returned will be
      a byte array, rather than a string. The reason has to do with the manner in which
      IDL passes strings, which requires that EZCA actually be passed pointers to byte
      arrays. When <code>caGet()</code> is called outside of a group it automatically
      converts the byte array to a string before returning the value. However when <code>
        caGet()</code> is called inside of a synchronous group it cannot perform this
      conversion, since it cannot be done until after the data is read, which does not
      occur until <code>caEndGroup()</code> is called. Thus, it is the user's responsibility
      to convert the data from a byte array to a string after calling <code>caEndGroup()</code>.
      This is done very simply with the <code>string()</code> function. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The following is an example of a valid grouped operation. It also shows how to handle
    strings.</p>
  <pre>
caStartGroup
status = caGet('test_mca1.VAL', mca_value)
status = caGet('test_vme1.DESC', vme_desc) ; This is a string PV
status = caEndGroup()
vme_desc = string(vme_desc)    ; Convert from byte array to string
</pre>
  <p>
    The following is an example of an <em>invalid</em> grouped operation.</p>
  <pre>
caStartGroup
status = caGet('test_mca1.VAL', mca_value)
status = caGet('test_vme1.VAL', vme_value)
mca_value=0
status = caEndGroup()
</pre>
  <p>
    Note that <code>mca_value</code> was redefined before calling <code>caEndGroup()</code>,
    so the previous location became undefined. <strong>Do not do this!</strong>></p>
  <h2>
    <a id="Error">Error Handling</a></h2>
  <p>
    All ezcaIDL routines which can generate errors return a status code to indicate
    success or failure. 0 indicates success, any other value indicates failure. These
    status codes are generally those returned by the routines in ezca.c, although some
    errors are returned directly from routines in <code>ezcaIDL.pro</code> and <code>ezcaIDL.c</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The EZCA routines will, by default, print brief diagnostic error messages when errors
    occur. These messages can be turned off by calling:</p>
  <pre>
    caError, /OFF
</pre>
  <p>
    A message describing the most recent error can be printed on stdout by calling:</p>
  <pre>
    caError, /PRINT
</pre>
  <p>
    A string describing the most recent error can be returned to the caller with:</p>
  <pre>
    caErrror, err_string
</pre>
  <p>
    For more information on error messages see the <a href="ezcaIDLRef.html#caError">description
      of caError in the ezcaIDL Reference Guide</a></p>
  <h2>

  <p>
    Detailed trace information for the EZCA routines can be obtained by calling:</p>

  <p>
    This can be turned off by calling</p>
  <pre>
    caTrace, 0

  <h2>
    <a id="Widgets">IDL Widgets</a></h2>
  <p>
    The file <code>ezcaIDLWidgets.pro</code> contains 3 routines which simplify the
    use of channel access, and particularly channel access monitors, with the IDL widget
    toolkit.
  </p>
  <h3>
    caWidgetSetMonitor(name, widget_id, time=time)</h3>
  <p>
    This function first adds a monitor on process variable "name", using routine <code>
      caSetMonitor()</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If this is the first time <code>caWidgetSetMonitor</code> has been called then it
    creates a dummy (iconified) widget which runs a timer routine. The timer routine
    periodically calls <code>caCheckMonitor(name)</code> to determine whether a channel
    access monitor has arrived for "name". If a monitor has occurred then an event will
    be sent to the widget whose ID is specified by "widget_id".
  </p>
  <p>
    The event structure is as follows:</p>
  <pre>
    event = 
      { id         ; The widget ID which was passed to caWidgetSetMonitor
        top:       ; The top level widget in this hierarchy
        handler:   ; The widget handler routine
        name:      ; The name of the process variable for which a monitor has
                   ; occurred.
      }
</pre>
  <p>
    When the event is sent, the event handler routine for the specified widget will
    be called. Generally this routine look at the <code>event.id</code> field to determine
    that this is a monitor event (rather than a mouse event). If the same event handler
    can receive monitor events from more than one process variable, (because <code>caWidgetSetMonitor</code>
    was called for several process variables) the event handler will then look at the
    <code>event.name</code> field to determine which process variable generated the
    monitor event.
  </p>
  <p>
    Typically the widget_id which is passed to <code>caWidgetSetMonitor</code> should
    be the id of a base widget. Base widgets cannot generate events due to mouse clicks,
    etc. so the widget event handler routine can distinguish monitor events from mouse
    events by looking at the <code>widget.id</code> field. This is the same concept
    which is described in the IDL documentation for timer events, e.g.</p>
  <pre>
    widget_control, wid, timer=1.0
</pre>
  <p>
    <code>caWidgetSetMonitor</code> can be called for many different process variable
    names and widget_ids. The widgets do not need to belong to the same widget hierarchy.
    Multiple widgets can monitor the same process variable, and the same widget can
    be used to monitor several process variables. Internally <code>caWidgetSetMonitor</code>
    maintains a list of all monitored process variables, and which widget_id(s) are
    to receive events from each process variable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The "time" keyword to <code>caWidgetSetMonitor</code> can be used to control the
    time interval between polling cycles. The default is 0.1 seconds.
  </p>
  <p>
    This routine sounds complex, but in fact it is simple to use and greatly simplifies
    the use of channel access monitors with IDL widget, since without it each widget
    event routine would have to poll to detect the arrival of channel access monitors.
    The following is a simple example of the use of this routine:
  </p>
  <pre>
pro example_event, event
    common example_common, pv_name, widget_ids
    ; This is the event handler routine, called whenever any type of event
    ; (monitor, mouse, timer) occurs.
   case event.id of

  <h3>
    caWidgetClearMonitor(name, widget_id)</h3>
  <p>
    This routine cancels the effect of <code>caWidgetSetMonitor</code>. If there are
    no other widgets monitoring this process variable then <code>caClearMonitor</code>
    is called to completely remove the channel access monitor on this name.
  </p>
  <h3>
    CaWidgetAdjust(name, font=font, min=min, max=max, label=label, group=group)
  </h3>
  <p>
    This is a general purpose routine for adjusting and monitoring a process variable.
    It creates widget which is appropriate for the data type of "name", i.e. a mutually
    exclusive menu for DBF_ENUM, a text entry widget for DBF_STRING and an editable
    slider widget for any numeric data type. This routine can be called from the event
    handler of larger applications when all that needs to be done is adjust the value
    of a process variable.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>name</code> is the name of the process variable to be adjusted.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>font</code> keyword can be used to specify a font to use.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> keywords can be used to specify the upper
    and lower limits of the slider widget when adjusting numeric process variables.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>label</code> keyword can be used to put a descriptive label at the top
    of the widget.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>group</code> keyword can be used to set the id of the parent widget. If
    the widget specified by <code>group</code> is deleted, then the widget created by
    <code>CaWidgetAdjust</code> will also be deleted.
